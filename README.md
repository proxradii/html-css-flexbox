# html-css-flexbox excercise
A single web page written with <b>HTML, CSS and Flexbox</b>. It was mainly an exercise to aid me in learning new technologies like Flexbox 
and to review some of the older ones like HTML and CSS.

<b>Things I learned while doing this excercise were: </b>

1) <i>The flex container and how all the children elements of the container become flex items.</i>
2) <i>The main axis and the cross axis of Flexbox.</i>
3) <i>The flex-direction property of the container establishes the main axis.</i>
4) <i>The main flex container propeties used are: flex-direction, flex-wrap, flex-flow, justify-content, align-items, align-content.</i>
5) <i>Using nested containers.</i>
6) <i>flex-grow, flex-shrink and flex-basis seem to be the most used flex item properties.</i>
